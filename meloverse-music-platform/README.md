# Meloverse – Music Streaming Platform (UI/UX Case Study)

**Meloverse** is a personalised, artist-centric music streaming UI that redefines how users connect with the music and artists they love.  
This project showcases the full interface design process: UX research, wireframes, UI design, interactive flows, and final high-fidelity mockups.

## Overview

Meloverse was designed to solve a core problem in modern music streaming apps:  
**users struggle to form meaningful connections because recommendations feel generic and artist interaction is shallow**  
:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

Meloverse focuses on:

- **Artist-centric discovery**  
- **Exclusive updates & merchandise**
- **Gamified rewards system (Points Page)**
- **Immersive UI with a starry-night theme**

The platform provides:

- Landing page  
- Login / Sign Up  
- Home page  
- Discovery page  
- Artist page (bio, albums, tracks, merch)  
- Song page (queue + playback)  
- Points system page  
- Profile & settings  
- Library page  

Screens and descriptions match the prototypes shown in the documentation  
(pages 15–22 for UI examples) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
