# 🎨 UI & UX Projects

A curated collection of my UI and UX design work across web applications, mobile apps, games, IoT systems, and startup concepts.  
This repository brings together my **Figma designs**, **hand-drawn illustrations**, **prototypes**, and **interface concepts** that support my development projects and academic assignments.

I design interfaces that are **visually cohesive**, **human-centred**, and grounded in clear user flows and problem-solving.
