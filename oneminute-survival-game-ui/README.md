## 📝 Problem / Design Brief

During the pandemic, people struggled with resource management, anxiety, and uncertain decision-making.  
**The goal:**  
Create a UI that simulates the emotional and strategic pressure of surviving a lockdown — while keeping the experience accessible, playable, and visually engaging.

The UI must:
- Communicate survival urgency  
- Show stats clearly (health, hunger, thirst, morale)  
- Support daily decision-making  
- Present randomized events in journal format  
- Fit naturally with the game’s pixel-art storytelling

- **Students/Educators** studying pandemic decision-making  
- **Players aged 14–30** who like pixel art, strategy, and simulation  
- Anyone who wants an immersive, simple gameplay experience with emotional stakes

## 🧪 Design Process

### 1. **Research**
- Collected references from survival games (60 Seconds!, Sheltered)
- Studied how games display limited resources & consequences
- Identified emotional tone → tense, cozy, gloomy depending on scene  

### 2. **Sketches & Early Concepts**
- Rough sketches in Procreate  
- Character moods: normal, sick, dead  
- Scene structure: shelves → cashier → living room → journals  

### 3. **Wireframes (Figma)**
Focused on:
- Consistent navigation  
- Information hierarchy  
- Journal → Decisions → Status update  

### 4. **High-fidelity UI**
- Pixel-art environment  
- Warm colours for home scenes  
- Bright colours for shopping phase  
- Dark, dramatic tones for defeat screen  

### 5. **Prototype**
Built clickable prototype in Figma with:
- Screen transitions  
- Button interactions  
- Day progression flow
